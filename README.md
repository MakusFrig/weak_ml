# weak_ml
This is my first attempt at anything to do with machine learning, even though I would barely even call my scripts machine learning. They should be using the averages of rgb values to help "guess" if a pictures belong to a certain category. Hopefully I will learn a lot about the difficulties of ai and ml throughout the journey.
