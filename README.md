After learning about the very basics of machine learning, like predicting whether something is above or below an average I decided to try to implement this with pictures. My script takes the average rgb values of a type of image, in this case "iron". It found that out of the limited sample size of five pictures the average RGB values were [100,100,100] approximatly. It then compares to another image of "iron". All of these pictures were found on the internet. It returned a match of around 80% for each rgb value. When comapring this to a 256x256 red square the results were less than 1 percent. While this is evidence of the script working I believe there will most definatly be more complications when it comes to identifying other metals against iron. For now this is a win though.
